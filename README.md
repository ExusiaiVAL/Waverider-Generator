# waverider-generator
 Outputs a cone-derived waverider from given basic flowfield informations and user-defined trailing edge. Main modules including solving Taylor-Maccoll equation and streamline tracing to form the lower surface

 User can specifies their UDF (User Defined Function) for the TE (Trailing Edge). 
 
 The program gives a visualization of:
 1. Diagram of the base cone, conical shock and user-defined trailing edge at the base plane.
 2. 3D wireframe of resulted cone-derived waverider

 The program gives outputs of .txt files for modeling in CAD software, enable this function in the output module of main.py
 
 Theory Guide and User Menu will be uploaded shortly under /doc file
